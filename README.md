# Sourcegraph for JetBrains IDEs [![JetBrains Plugin](https://img.shields.io/badge/JetBrains-Sourcegraph-green.svg)](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9682-sourcegraph)

The Sourcegraph plugin for JetBrains IDEs enables you to quickly open and search code on Sourcegraph easily and efficiently in JetBrains IDEs such as IntelliJ. This plugin works with most JetBrains IDEs:

- IntelliJ IDEA
- IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition
- PhpStorm
- WebStorm
- PyCharm
- PyCharm Community Edition
- RubyMine
- AppCode
- CLion
- GoLand
- DataGrip
- Rider
- Android Studio

## Installation

- Select `IntelliJ IDEA` then `Preferences` (or use <kbd>⌘,</kbd>)
- Click `Plugins` in the left-hand pane.
- Choose `Browse repositories...`
- Search for `Sourcegraph` -> `Install`

## Usage

Right click any code or selection and choose `Sourcegraph: Open` or `Sourcegraph: Search`.

Keyboard Shortcuts:

| Description                     | Mac                 | Linux / Windows  |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| Open file in Sourcegraph        | <kbd>Option+A</kbd> | <kbd>Alt+A</kbd> |
| Search selection in Sourcegraph | <kbd>Option+S</kbd> | <kbd>Alt+S</kbd> |

## Settings

The plugin is configurable _globally_ by creating a `sourcegraph-jetbrains.properties` in your home directory. For example, modify the following URL to match your on-premises Sourcegraph instance URL:

```
url = https://sourcegraph.example.com
```

You may also choose to configure it _per repository_ using a `.idea/sourcegraph.xml` file in your repository like so:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project version="4">
    <component name="Config">
        <option name="url" value="https://sourcegraph.example.com" />
    </component>
</project>
```

By default, the plugin will use the `origin` git remote to determine which repository on Sourcegraph corresponds to your local repository. If your `origin` remote doesn't match Sourcegraph, you may instead configure a `sourcegraph` Git remote which will take priority.

- To create `sourcegraph.jar`:
  1. Update `plugin.xml` (change version AND describe changes in change notes).
  2. Update `Util.java` (change `VERSION` constant).
  3. Update `README.md` (copy changelog from plugin.xml).
  4. choose `Build` -> `Prepare Plugin Module 'sourcegraph' For Deployment`
  5. `git commit -m "all: release v<THE VERSION>"` and `git push` and `git tag v<THE VERSION>` and `git push --tags`
  6. Upload the jar to the releases tab of this repository.
  7. Publish according to http://www.jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/basics/getting_started/publishing_plugin.html (note: it takes ~2 business days for JetBrains support team to review the plugin).
